 * To keep initialization simple, a component should only have an
 * initialization function if it is stricly necessary.
 *
 * For example, if a component is a contiki process, initialization
 * should preferably happen when the process receives the contiki \ref
 * PROCESS_EVENT_INIT event.  Initializer functions should only be
 * created if the component initialization can fail critically or if
 * two components are mutually dependent.

 * initializer, it is important to include both (in respectively the
 * init_steps and the autostart).
 *
 * Special note for tests that use ZIP_Router.c: Note that if
 * ZIP_Router.c is included, it will do most of the initializations
 * and also the process_start for the rest of the processes.  So these
 * test cases should not start ZGW processes themselves.
 *
 * If any of the initializers fail, the whole system will fail to start.
