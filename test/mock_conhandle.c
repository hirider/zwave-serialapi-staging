- when sending fram with one reply
  ConUpdate() should not return conFrameReceived,
  then ConTxFrame() sends the frame, no return value,
  then ConUpdate() should return conFrameSent,
  then ConUpdate() should return conFrameReceived and the response should be in serBuf.

- when injecting an unsolicited frame
  the conhandler mock should be idle,
  the frame should be put in serBuf as a REQUEST,
  the conhandler status should be set to conFrameReceived,
  the poll handler should be triggered (it needs two iterations, but it will re-trigger itself),
  ConUpdate should return conFrameReceived.

- when sending frame with two replies
  ConUpdate() should not return conFrameReceived,
  then ConTxFrame() sends the frame, no return value,
  then ConUpdate() should return conFrameSent,
  then ConUpdate() should return conFrameReceived and the response should be in serBuf,
  then the second response should be injected.

/* The serial interface is a layered system.

 *                        and handles Rx.
 *                        Installs a pollhandler that will be called
 *                        from the contiki main loop when select shows data on
 *                        the serial fd.  The pollhandler calls
 *                        SerialAPI_Poll(), re-triggers polling as
 *                        long as there is data, and finally calls
 *                        secure_poll() (which does what??)
 *
 * ./src/serialapi/
 *
 * Serialapi.c - implements the protocol functions from INS12350
 *               Serial API Host Appl. Prg. Guide, but also the serial
 *               interface logic.
 *               Uses internal communication interface functions
 *               SendFrame and SendFrameWithResponse on the TX side,
 *               DrainRx and Dispatch on the RX side.
 *               Provides external communication interfaces
 *               ZW_SendData() and ZW_SendData_Bridge() on the Tx side
 *               SerialAPI_Poll() on the Rx side
 *               Keeps an array of timers.
 *
 *               RX: Maintains an Rx queue (QueueFrame(), ) for ??.
 *               Dispatch() tests the incoming frame, byte
 *               pData[IDX_CMD], and calls the corresponding installed
 *               callback from callbacks.  If the command is
 *               send-data, the callback from ZW_SendData is called
 *               and cleared.  Ie, callbacks are executed in
 *               serial_api_process context. TODO: pass them on to
 *               another process context.
 *
 *               SerialAPI_Poll() is called from the poll handler of
 *               the contiki process serial_api_process.  It
 *               Dispatch()'es everything in the rx queue, calls
 *               DrainRx to queue all incoming requests (ignoring
 *               other frames), (calls ApplicationPoll, which is NULL
 *               in the ZGW), and returns true if the rx queue is not
 *               empty.
 *
 *               TX:
 *
 * conhandle.c - Generates/unpacks serial frames and handles serial
 *               protocol logic, such as waiting for ACK after
 *               sending.  Relies on the functions in port.h
 *               (linux-serial.c) to actually interface with the OS.
 *
 * in ./contiki/cpu/native/
 * linux-serial.c - handles the system file descriptor.  Also the fd
 *                  for the serial log.  Based on select/read/write.
 *                  Uses shared .h file ./src/serialapi/port.h
 *
 * contiki_main.c calls select() on the fds and calls poll on the
 * serial_api_process (and the other fds).  So when conhandle also
 * calls SerialCheck() to invoke select(), this is redundant in ZGW
 * context.  It is there so that conhandle can also function as a
 * stand-alone tool.
 *
 *
 * Note: ./contiki/core/dev/serial-line.c - reads from stdin, not from
 *       the chip.  A contiki process that maintains a ring buffer. */
