/**
 * Read the lock bits, LockData.
 * Nine bytes can be set by executing the "Write Lock Bits" command. The bits in these bytes can be set
 * one at the time or both at the same time, but once they are set they can't be cleared. The state of the
 * lock bits can always be read with the "Read Lock Bits" command.
 * The lock bits can be read and set from a programming interface. Only an "Erase Chip" operation can
 * erase the lock bits. The lock bits are used to:
 *  - Enable read back-protection of code space
 *  - Auto Programming Mode lock bits.
 *  - Set erase-protection on part of code area. Only protects against erase operations initiated by the
 *    MCU. Contained in the bytes EP0-EP7
 *
 *    Lock bit bytes:
 *     Byte    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
 *     Field EP0 EP1 EP2 EP3 EP4 EP5 EP6 EP7 RBAP
 * Setting either of these Lock bits will not prevent the internal MCU from reading the Flash memory
 * Note: A "Set Lockbit" command must always be followed by "Check State" command(s) to ensure that
 * the chip is idle before new commands are issued.
 *
 * The RBAP byte, as shown in Table 7, contains the 2 lock bits for controlling the Non-volatile Auto Prog
 * setting (bits 2 and 1), see section 5.2, for a description of how to use these bits.
 * The RBAP byte also contains the Read-Back protection lock bit (bit 0). When this bit is 0b, the chip will
 * return 00h when reading from Flash code space. The CRC32 check function still works even if the chip is
 * read-back protected.
 * Bits 7-3 are unused and MUST be kept high, as they are reserved for future use.
 * Bit   |   7|  6 |  5 |  4 |  3 |         2 |          1 |                   0 |
 * Field | 1b | 1b | 1b | 1b | 1b | AutoProg1 | Auto Prog0 | Readback Protection |
 *
 *
 * The string "EP7:EP6:EP5:EP4:EP3:EP2:EP1:EP0" is a 64 bit string, where each bit controls the MCU's
 * ability to erase and program a Flash code sector. The bits are coded so that EP7 bit 7 controls sector 63
 * and EP0 bit 0 controls sector 0. E.g. EP3 bit 2 controls sector 26.
 * When a bit is 0b, the associated sector is protected from erasure and programmed by the internal MCU.
 * The bits can only be set to1b by executing the "Chip Erase" command.
 *
 * \param num byte number to read
 * \return lock byte, -1 if operation was unsuccessful.
