/**
 * \ingroup ZIP_MDNS
 * \defgroup ZIP_Resource Z/IP Resource Directory
 *
 * The Resource Directory is a database containing information about
 * all nodes in the PAN network.
 *
 * This module probes/interviews nodes in the PAN network for their
 * supported command classes, security, multi-endpoint capabilities,
 * etc., and stores the results.
 *
 * #### Dead Node Detection ####
 *
 * The Resource Directory also tries to keep track of the health state
 * of the nodes in the PAN network by tracking whether the last
 * communication with a node was successfull.
 *
 * For #MODE_ALWAYSLISTENING nodes and FLIRS nodes
 * (#MODE_FREQUENTLYLISTENING), the node is set to failing
 * (#STATUS_FAILING) if it fails to respond to a frame sent by a
 * client.
 *
 * Since a wake-up node (#MODE_MAILBOX) may be unresponsive even when
 * it is healthy, the Resource Directory only sets it failing if it
 * has not been heard from in 3 times its wake-up interval.  The RD
 * does this by periodically checking the mailbox nodes
 * (#rd_check_for_dead_nodes_worker()).
 *
 * \note This implies that a mailbox node with wake-up interval 0 is never set
 * failing.
 *
 * In either case, as soon as the Z/IP Gateway receives a frame from a
 * failing node, it will mark it as not failing (#STATUS_DONE).  The
 * received frame could be a command or an ACK.
 *
 * This tracking only starts after the initial inteview has been
 * completed successfully.  If a new interview is requested
 * (#NODE_INFO_CACHED_GET), tracking is again suspended until
 * successful completion.
 *
 * \see #rd_set_failing, #rd_node_is_alive(), #rd_node_is_unreachable().
 *
 *
 * #### mDNS Support ####
 *
 * The Resource Directory works closely with the \ref ZIP_MDNS. \ref
 * ZIP_MDNS uses the information collected in the resource directory
 * to send replies on the LAN side.  When nodes are added or removed
 * on the PAN side, the Resource Directory may trigger gratuitous mDNS
 * packets on the LAN side (e.g., mDNS goodbye).
 *
 * #### Network Management Interaction ####
 * The Resource Directory also works closely with \ref NW_CMD_handler.
 * The NetworkManagement module can create and destroy entries in the
 * database and triggers/blocks the probe machine.
