 * Control of the Z-Wave network is carried out through a number of Network
 * Management Command Classes.
 *
 * The Z/IP Gateway MUST support all four Network Management Command Classes:
 * - Network Management Inclusion: Support for Adding/Removing, Set Default,
 *   Failed Node Replacement and Removal and Requesting Node Neighbor Update
 * - Network Management Basic: Support for entering Learn Mode, Node Information Send
 *   and Request Network Update
 * - Network Management Proxy: Support for Node List Get and Node Info Cached Get
 * - Network Management Primary: Support for Controller Change, only available
 *   when operating as Primary Controller without SIS functionality.
 *
 * These four command classes enable network management and access to simple network topology information.
