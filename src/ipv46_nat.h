 * \defgroup ip46nat IPv4 to IPv6 network address translator.

 * This module contains supporting features that allows the gateway to understand and use IPv4 addresses.
 *
 * These features are used by the Z/IP Gateway processes \ref
 * ZIP_DHCP, \ref ZIP_ipv4, \ref Portal_handler and in Contiki.
 *
 * The module maps IPv4 UDP and ICMP ping packages into their IPv6
 * equivalents and vice versa. This is done to allow the internal Z/IP
 * Gateway IPv6 logic to process the IPv4 frames as well.
 *
 * It also contains the data-structures that hold the IPv4 addresses
 * for the Z-Wave network nodes.
